# (Unofficial) Mac OSX Support
Before continuing, please acknowledge that this method uses a launcher put together by a non-staff entity. The launcher is opensource (you can view it here). We don't expect any issues, but proceed at your own risk. 
[TTPA is not responsible for anything that happens as a result of you installing his launcher.]
# Let's Go!
Install "ttpa.dmg" from https://github.com/judge2020/AltisLauncher-Mac/releases

You should see this~

Run through the rest of the installation process, entering your Mac password when prompted.

Once that's complete, open "nvidia openCG"

You should see this:

Enter your Mac password and run through the rest of the installation process.

Once that's complete, drag "Project Altis" into your Applications folder

Go into Applications and run "Project Altis"

You should see a window open looking like this~

The first thing you want to do is click "Redownload files"

(Wait 10-15 minutes before proceeding) There is a glitch that prevents the launcher from letting you know when the download is complete, so give it 15+ minutes to be safe.

After waiting around 15 minutes, type in your TTPA username & password into the fields and click "Play". You should now be in the game!

# Epilogue

This launcher was made by and wouldn't be possible without Judge2020/Hunter. Go thank him if you see him hanging around!

To reiterate, this is an unofficial launcher, made by a non-staff entity. You are using this at your own risk.

The launcher/game is very buggy with Mac/Wine ~ report all bugs with the launcher to Judge2020 on Discord.

Due to it utilizing Wine (a Windows emulator) and not natively porting it over to Mac, the game's performance will be severely under that of the game run by a Windows machine. Of course, this will vary depending on your machine's specs.

Native Mac OS X Support is still planned. This should just be a temporary solution.

A video tutorial will be coming out very soon, so stay tooned for that!

Any other questions? PM Judge2020 on Discord!
